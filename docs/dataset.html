        <h1>Dataset Description</h1>
        <h2>Source</h2>
        <p>The dataset for this project is sourced from The Movie Database (TMDb) and Kaggle. The dataset was chosen for its comprehensive coverage of movies across diverse genres and its inclusion of both textual (synopses) and visual (posters) features, making it ideal for multi-modal learning.</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains 84,094 movies, each tagged with one or more of the 19 genres, including Drama, Comedy, Horror, Mystery, TV Movie, History, and more. It has three subsets: 63,639 movies for training (75.7%), 7,981 for validation (9.5%), and 7,963 for testing (9.5%), fostering good model development and evaluation. Each movie record has two main features: the plot synopsis (text, typically 50â€“200 words) that describes the storyline of the movie, and a poster image (visual, in various resolutions) that depicts thematic and stylistic aspects. While the genres a movie belongs to can be many, which indicates real-world complexity, the imbalanced nature of this dataset can prove a challenge for any classifier. Common genres like Drama and Comedy have a vast number of samples, whereas less common genres like TV Movie and History have fewer samples, thus making it difficult for classification.</p>
        <h2>Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
        <p>Comprehensive preprocessing was indeed done to characterize the data as optimal for machine learning. The plot synopsis was tokenized using a standard word tokenizer and stripped of special characters, punctuation, and stop words to minimize noise for text data. To keep the consistency needed for the LSTM model, all synopses were padded or truncated to a maximum sentence length of 100 tokens and used GloVe embedding to convert tokens to dense vectors. The synopsis left empty or missing were either populated with a common placeholder or excluded, which is less than 2% of the data. For image data, the poster images were resized to a standard dimension of 224x224 so that such image input can be fed directly into the ResNet18 model. All images normalized (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) and during training, augmented by giving random rotations and random horizontal-flips to these pictures making it even more strong. Some missing posters were replaced by a standard value grayscale image or removed, but this process had no impact.</p>
        <p>The genre labels were encoded as binary vectors, with 1 denoting presence and 0 denoting absence. The distributions of genres were preserved in stratified splits of train, validation, and test data, ensuring that there was no bias toward the dominant genres. Given the limited number of samples in TV Movie and History, additional measures, such as applying class weights to reduce the imbalance during training, were implemented. Data cleaning involved resolving inconsistencies like duplicate movies or incorrectly labelled genres, as identified through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Therefore, despite this list of activities leading to a high-grade dataset, there were still key challenges, such as imbalance between the genres and overlap in features, which affected the model's performance and error analysis.</p>
